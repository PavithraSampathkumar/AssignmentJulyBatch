        <p>The India of long ago was divided into many small kingdoms, 
            and in each kingdom, there were wonderful cities, with fortified walls 
            and well-trained armies to guard them. The people in these ancient cities
             dressed in silks and jewels and rode in chariots, and all were happy and well cared for. 
             One of these kingdoms was called Ayodhya, and it was ruled by a king called Dasa Ratha. 
             He was a good king, much loved by his people and by his three wives.
              His only sorrow was that he had no children.</p>

           <p>One day, when Dasa Ratha was out on a hunting expedition, he became separated from the rest of
             the party and spent the day roaming the forest with his bow and arrows without seeing a single animal. 
             As evening approached he turned towards home, tired and dispirited.</p> 
            
           <p> At that moment he heard the sound of an animal lapping water on the other side of the 
            small lake on whose banks he was walking. It was too dark to see across the lake but 
            Dasa Ratha was a wonderful shot, and he prided himself that he could shoot blindfold 
            at anything within range, and bring it down with a single row. So he raised his bow and let fly
             in the direction of the sound of the lapping deer.
